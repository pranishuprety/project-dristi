#  Project Dristi ‚Äî Smart Cane & Assistive App for the Visually Impaired

Hi, we are **Team Dristi**.  
We created two powerful and independent tools that enhance safety, navigation, and communication for the visually impaired:

-  **iSight Cane** ‚Äì a smart Raspberry Pi-powered walking cane
-  **Dristi App** ‚Äì a web-based assistive assistant built with Flask and React

These systems **work independently** ‚Äî but like an Apple Watch and iPhone, they **work even better together**.

##  iSight Cane ‚Äî Affordable Smart Navigation

The **iSight Cane** is designed to reduce the cost of accessible technology:

-  **>90% cheaper** than commercial smart canes (under $100 vs. $1000+)
-  **Built with Raspberry Pi 4**, ultrasonic sensor, buzzer, haptic motor
-  Alerts the user with **vibration and sound** when an obstacle is detected within ~50cm
-  Sends sensor data to the Dristi App if connected via WiFi
-  Standalone functionality (no app required)

##  Dristi App ‚Äî Voice-Based Assistive Web App

The **Dristi App** is a fully functional assistive web tool built with:

-  **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (frontend)  
-  **Python + Flask** (backend)

Key Features:
-  Real-time **live location tracking**
-  Voice-guided **compass navigation**
-  Emergency **SOS alerts**
-  **Weather and hazard** notifications
-  Conversational **AI voice assistant**
-  Scene understanding via **image-to-text** and **PDF-to-speech**

The app can work standalone ‚Äî or receive real-time updates from the iSight Cane.
